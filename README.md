# Syntactic-Analyser-CPSC-323
Final Version of a Syntactic Analyser constructed for CPSC 323, Compilers and Languages, taught by Anthony Le during the Fall 2020 semester at CSUF.
Constructed in Visual Studio and written in C++.
Made by a collaboration between Nicole (myself) and Zachary.

The purpose of the assignment was to design a syntactic analyzer. The syntactic analyzer is capable of reading in a file and break down each statement into non terminals. From there each non terminal reaches a terminal state to confirm that it is a syntactically correct line of code. The project is divided into 3 main parts: Arithmetic Expressions, Assignment Statements and Declarative Statements. The syntactical analyzer is implemented using the RDP method. The parser then prints tokens, lexemes and the production rules used.

Addition documentation avaliable in the SRS document.
